# *When Life Is Hard : Finding Solid Ground When Life Rocks*

# *Life is unpredictable. One moment, everything seems stable; the next, we’re caught in a storm of trials that shake our faith, challenge our beliefs, and leave us questioning everything we thought we knew about God and ourselves. In When Life Is Hard, Pastor James MacDonald offers a powerful, biblically grounded perspective on suffering, pain, and perseverance through life’s most difficult seasons. This book isn’t a collection of simplistic platitudes or quick fixes; instead, it’s a profound exploration of the nature of trials, God’s involvement, our response, and the ultimate purposes that can be forged in the crucible of hardship.*
